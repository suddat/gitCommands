				<li> <b> git checkout HEAD filename : </b> <span>  Discards changes in the working directory. (rm filename && svn up) </span> </li>
				<li> <b> git branch -d branch_name : </b> <span>  now the changes has been merged into master, purpose of fencing is done, so delete it with this command. </span> </li>
				<li> <b>git clone: </b> <span> Creates a local copy of a remote.</span> </li>
				<li> <b>git remote -v: </b> <span> Lists a Git project's remotes.</span> </li>
